* param, in this case instead of being locked to one specific array (const recipes), the function can work with any array of recipes you want to pass into it, allowing you to filter, sort, or use different recipe collections without changing the function itself. The param makes the function reusabel, flexibel and dynamic. 

* render means to display content on a webpage. You take data (this case recipes) and convert them into visible HTML elements that users can see and interact with.
