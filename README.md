# js-project-recipe-library

https://jrecipelibrary.netlify.app/

This was my second project, where we built on from html, css and some Javascript to include API, fetching from open API, static arrays and much more. The design was provided by a designer so I also learnt how to follow a design during this project eventhough I made sure to add some personal touches, like the colors. It was a really fun project, made me deep dive a bit more into Javascript.
